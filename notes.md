## Markdown
MarkdownEditing comes with some great extras for writing in Markdown. Notable
features include syntax highlighting inside fenced code blocks, automatic
pairing for bold/italic, smarter list management, and some handy keyboard
shortcuts.

However it does come with some strongly opinionated default settings, which
require overriding, such as using <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Tab</kbd> to collapse
scope.
